All requested changes have been implemented successfully, and the application builds without errors.

Here's a summary of the latest changes:
- `components/Sidebar.tsx`:
    - The sidebar's width has been adjusted to `md:w-[170px]` on medium screens and above.
- `app/layout.tsx`:
    - The left margin of the main content `div` has been adjusted to `md:ml-[170px]` to match the new sidebar width, ensuring the content is pushed to the right and appears side-by-side with the fixed sidebar.

The CSS properties implemented (`fixed` sidebar, `flex-row` on body, `md:ml` on content) are designed to achieve a side-by-side layout for medium screens and above. If the sidebar is still "blocking" content, it might indicate a more complex layout issue that would require further investigation, possibly involving screenshots or a more precise description of the blocking behavior.
