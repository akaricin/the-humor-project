All requested changes have been implemented successfully, and the application builds without errors.

Here's a summary of the latest changes:
- `components/Sidebar.tsx`:
    - Confirmed sidebar width is `md:w-[250px]`.
    - Removed `hover:bg-gray-600` from both `Link` components (sidebar buttons) to disable the background color change on hover, thus preventing an apparent text color change.

The sidebar width remains at 250px and the hover effect on the sidebar links has been removed as requested.
