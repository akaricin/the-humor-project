All requested changes have been implemented successfully, and the application builds without errors.

Here's a summary of the latest changes:
- `components/Sidebar.tsx`:
    - Removed `mt-10` from the `nav` element to ensure the sidebar's background extends all the way to the top.
    - Increased the sidebar's width from `md:w-[200px]` to `md:w-[250px]`.
    - Sidebar buttons (Link components):
        - Width changed from `w-full` to `w-4/5`.
        - Centered horizontally using `mx-auto`.
        - Rounded style changed from `rounded` to `rounded-xl` for a more pronounced rounded rectangle shape.
        - `mb-6` class added to both `Link` components to ensure spacing between them.
- `app/layout.tsx`:
    - Adjusted `md:ml-[200px]` to `md:ml-[250px]` in the main content `div` to correctly offset the content based on the new 250px sidebar width.

These changes should ensure the sidebar no longer covers the main content, its background extends fully, its width is increased, buttons are styled as rounded rectangles with shorter width, and there is spacing between them.
