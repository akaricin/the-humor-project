All requested changes have been implemented successfully, and the application builds without errors.

Here's a summary of the latest changes:
- `components/Sidebar.tsx`:
    - The sidebar's width has been updated to `md:w-[250px]` on medium screens and above.
- `app/layout.tsx`:
    - The left margin of the main content `div` has been updated to `md:ml-[250px]` to match the new sidebar width and ensure consistent layout.
- `app/page.tsx` (Hello World page):
    - Added `ml-[250px]` to the main `main` element to push the page content to the right, adjacent to the sidebar.
- `app/images/page.tsx` (Images page):
    - Added `ml-[250px]` to both `main` elements (for the "No images found" case and the image gallery) to ensure their content is also pushed to the right.

These changes should ensure the sidebar is properly positioned side-by-side with the webpage content, preventing any blocking.
